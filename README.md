# end-fight
A Minecraft Spigot/Paper plugin that creates a competitive server-wide event when the Ender Dragon is killed: the Dragon Egg spawns at a random overworld location, broadcasts its coordinates, allows temporary teleportation to the carrier, and declares a winner after holding the egg for a set duration.
